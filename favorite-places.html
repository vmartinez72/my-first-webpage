    <h1>My Favorites Places To Visit</h1>

    <h3>These are my favorite places around the world to visit.</h3>

    <h2>1. Tokyo, Japan</h2>

    <p>Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.</p>

    <h2>2. Oahu, Hawaii</h2>
    <img src="img/hawaii1.jpg" alt="oahu">
    <p>Oahu, also known as The Gathering Place, is made up of two separate but overlapping volcanoes, known as a volcanic doublet. Its asymmetrical butterfly shape is formed by two mountain ranges: the Waianae Range in the west and the Ko'olau Range in the east. Slicing through the center is the flat Leilehua Plateau. Recent (geologically speaking) volcanic eruptions in the southeastern portion of the island which formed the Diamond Head, Koko Head, and Punchbowl craters can be blamed for Oahu's uneven shape.</p>

    <h2>3. Cannon Beach, Oregon</h2>

    <p>Well-known by northwest natives and tourists alike, Cannon Beach is one of Oregon’s most popular coastal destinations. The beach is renowned for its beauty, and the diversity of activities, wildlife, and proximity to Portland add to its merits. The beach takes its name from the 1922 discovery of a cannon from the wreckage of the USS Shark.  William Clark first recorded his visits to the area in 1806 while the Lewis and Clark expedition wintered at nearby Fort Clatsop.</p>

    <h2>4. Seattle, Washington</h2>
    <img src="img/seattle.jpg" alt="seattle">
    <p>In the past few decades, Seattle has quietly grown from a far-flung port city not registering on too many radar screens, to being nationally recognized as one of the most livable cities in the US. This recognition is based on criteria such as a critical mass of advanced technology, diverse economic sectors such as agriculture, services, manufacturing and international trade, superior educational and health care, (First Hill just east of downtown has been nicknamed "Pill Hill" due to the number of medical facilities crowded onto its slopes), public safety, a well-educated work force, quality of life and the international outlook of its people. The popularity of Seattle's natural and cultural amenities, that so epitomize the attraction of the Northwest, see the city now faced with the challenge of preserving its livability under the pressure of increasing residential and tourist populations.</p>

    <h2>5. Portland, Oregon</h2>

    <p>Big city excitement and small town charm make Portland, Oregon, known as "the City of Roses", one of the favorite destinations in the West. Portland is situated approximately 70 miles from the Pacific in a magnificent setting between the sparkling waters of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. Portland's historic old town, galleries and museums, Saturday Market, and theatre companies will keep visitors busy for weeks! Its lush green parks are perfect for a picnic or an afternoon stroll. Also, Portland is just a short distance from Willamette valley wineries, skiing at Timberline Lodge and all of the excitement and beauty of Oregon's spectacular ocean beaches.</p>
